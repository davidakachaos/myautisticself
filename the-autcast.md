description: The AutCast is my podcast on autism and neurodiversity in general. With this podcast I try in my own way to explain different topics as I discuss them here on my blog.
---
The AutCast podcast can be seen as an extension of this blog. I try to discuss different topics and am always open to suggestions. It's a way to reach out to more people and publish about autism.

Currently the podcast is only in Dutch and there are no plans for now to do a English show...

Of course I will talk about my own autism in particular, but I will also try to talk about autism in general and what I get from the community. Do you disagree with something? That's possible! I don't know the truth, but I will always do my best to be as clear as possible.

## Feedback is always welcome!
