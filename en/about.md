My name is David Westerink. I was born in 1984 and have Asperger syndrome, [nowadays just plain autism]({% post_url /2019/2019-11-25-asperger-is-also-just-autism %}). In addition, I am the father of two children, divorced and a software developer by education. My son [is in this neurodiverse world]({% post_url /2019/2019-12-03-welcome-to-the-team-little-guy %}), just like myself.

I decided to write a blog about my autism and my experiences in the "normal" world. With the aim to inform people and explain autism. With the underlying goal to make the world a better place for autistic people and to teach the world to understand us more.

This of course starts with understanding myself, so here I write down my opinions and my explanation of how I see the world. Now and then I also try to explain how I think autism and neurodiversity should be dealt with. These blogs also help me to understand myself better and by explaining my experiences to the (digital) paper, I am also more and more able to do this in person.

Since I started this blog in the summer of 2019, I am more and more developing myself as an experience expert and getting involved in the struggle for [acceptance of neurodiversity]({% post_url /2019/2019-11-28-what-is-neurodiversity %}) as a thing in our society. I notice that many untruths about autism (and other "disorders") are still being told and that there are still many ambiguities within professional care as well. Through this blog, talking for groups, an upcoming podcast and by being open to my environment I want to fight for a better mutual understanding.

Because even though I am an autistic person, I am also just a human being :wink: I don't bite (hard).
