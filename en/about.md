title: About me
---
<p> My name is David Westerink. I was born in 1984 and have Asperger's syndrome. I am also the father of two children, divorced and a software developer. </p>
<p> I have decided to write a blog about my autism and my experiences in the "normal" world. With the aim of informing people and being able to explain about autism. </p>
