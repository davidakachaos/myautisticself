Since I started this blog I have used a comment system called Disqus. This blog was not actually used by visitors to my blog. Not so strange actually, because most of the reactions I get outside of my blog. In particular via Twitter and Facebook. Commenting via the blog itself was never actually done.

This is not bad at all, finally I also share my blogs via social media and I also respond to the feedback I receive there. However, it is true that my blog was delayed by the Disqus system. So today I decided to remove the comments. Instead I will use another system called "Webmentions"

# Webmentions? What is that?

I myself am an computer person, but I will try to explain the concept here without too much technical fuss and difficult words. Webmentions is a technology where websites can respond to each other. This is a system that has been roaming the internet for some time. You may have heard about the concept of "Pingback". Pingback is a way for a website (usually a blog) to let another website (also usually a blog) know that a response has been given to an article in the form of an article on another website.

This is all nice and sweet, but why am I switching to this system? Like I said, I get responses via social media such as Twitter. The system that I use from today on this website will display this response to my posts below.

# Facebook responses

Unfortunately it is not possible to display Facebook responses below. Without going into too much technical details; Facebook does not offer this possibility. It is also true that I share my blog posts in restricted groups, so the reactions are meant for the group and not outside of it. But they are not listed under my posts.

# So are comments a thing of the past?

No, you can still respond via Twitter on my blog. Also via Facebook I am always approachable and you can just leave comments through that way. But the comments under my posts have indeed disappeared. However, these have never been used until now. So I don't think they will be missed either.

So if you have any feedback on my posts, please let me know via the channels you used so far!
