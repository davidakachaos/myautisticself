I gave a webinar on 26 August. This was recorded via Microsoft Teams and I put this recording online. You can watch this video here. 
So if you didn't have the opportunity to watch it, or if you just want to see it again, you can do so here (or on YouTube).

Please note this webinar is in Dutch! No translation will be done for now. If you would like a English version, please message me through one of my social media.
