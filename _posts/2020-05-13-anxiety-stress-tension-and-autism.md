I had an interview with Autism in Context about fear, stress, tension and autism. This interview was posted on their YouTube channel "Fear and Autism". On this channel you can find several interviews with autistic people who talk about their experiences with stress and tension.

In this interview I discuss my ways of dealing with stress, fear and tension. Below you can watch the interview. This interview is in Dutch, just a heads up :wink:
