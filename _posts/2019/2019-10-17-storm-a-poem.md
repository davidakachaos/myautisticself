It sometimes storms in my head \
Thoughts rage, feelings hunt \
Storm in my head

When I look around me in my dreams, \
A lot of things are passing by \
Thoughts for the future \
Thoughts of happiness and opulence

You are only really rich when you no longer want anything \
Tell the stories \
Storm around me, there on the edge of the coast \
Standing on a rock in the surf\
Chained in the wind, accompanied by the tide

Light on the horizon, end of the storm in sight \
Falling in peace, silence ... \
The eye of the storm, everything around me comes to rest \
Rest with promise of the storm, the storm that rushes on \
But this storm is blowing past \
The last waves are retreating

After the storm everything feels clean and calm \
It is wonderful to be here \
The storm is raging in the distance, I am not sure yet ... \
Storm of feeling, emotion and promise \
Someday the time will come when the storm will not only revolve around me \
That I am no longer alone on the rock in the surf

I take a deep breath and watch the storm \
The storm that rages and sinks ships \
The storm that flew against me to knock me off the rock\
But I am still there, I am still there \
And in the distance the sun is shining, other ships are sailing \
Ships to new places ...

The storm is coming, but I am solid now \
New found peace, new found goals \
Now comes the storm, I feel the wind and the waves \
Someday I won't be alone here ... \
And never forget that I am there, not just for myself \
The wind blows, the waves hit, the ships disappear in the rain

But in the distance the sun shines, \
Are the ships waiting ...\
The storm is coming ....\
I can handle this!
