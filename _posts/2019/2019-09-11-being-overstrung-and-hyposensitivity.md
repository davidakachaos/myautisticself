Apparently I was overwhelmed the last few days. I felt "off", not good in my skin and grumpy. Apparently that was the reason for some of my own behaviors and feelings that played out. It may be a bit strange to read, but I don't really notice getting overstrung very well. What is the reason for this? Being sensitive to many things, including my own feelings and emotions.

# Not noticing getting overstrung

If you read about overstimulation on the internet, you will always come across the same stories. People who, for example, have a headache due to sound or light. People soon notice that they are over-stimulated, usually within a few minutes to hours.
I only notice this much later. And then I talk about days or sometimes even weeks later. And then I often have to be pointed out by others. I usually do not realize this myself. And why? Because I'm hyposensitive to stimuli. [I previously wrote a blog post about this]({% post_url /2019/2019-06-18-ondergevoeligheid-en-autisme%}).
Here I mainly describe my own experience with being hyposensitive. Because incentives and impressions come to me less than with most people, I also notice much later that I am over-stimulated.
Only after other people point out certain behavior to me, do I find out why I react or act that way. And through a recent conversation with my guidance, I have come to the conclusion that I have become over-stimulated.

# Getting to know I'm getting overstrung

For me to realize that I am overwhelmed is something that I am exploring. It is not a simple way for me to say "Oh, all those sounds give me such a headache!" or the like. But because of conversations with other people, such as guidance, I am getting to know signals.

Those signals are personal of course. Indifference is a signal that comes to my mind. Indifferent to the world around me. The heavier my over-stimulation, the more indifferent I become. Also not being able to stick to structure is a clear signal to me. I do not have an internal structure of my own, it must be imposed on me from outside. When I get overwhelmed, I become more indifferent and my structure is lost.

It is an challenge for me to recognize these signals on time. Because I am hyposensitive to signals from my environment and from myself, recognition of these signals also comes in late. But I am increasingly successful in recognizing these things in myself.

## Being overstrung doesn't happen to me in one go

What is important to mention here is that over-stimulation does not come to me in one go. It is (often) a sum of various factors that ultimately cause over-stimulation. Because of my own sensitivity to incentives, I only realize the effect of an event later. And then other things have already happened of course. Even if I check whether I can cope with something about over-stimulation, the answer is often yes. This is because I do not yet realize that everything together can cause over-stimulation.

Fortunately, I now have a better understanding of this and am busy finding ways to prevent this. Finally, acknowledging the problem is the first step to solving the problem.

# Managing being overstrung

Once I realize that I am overwhelmed, I now know better what to do. Recharging myself is a big part of that. I do this by doing things that give me energy instead of costs. For my environment, this usually means that I withdraw from social obligations. That I take time for myself and don't feel like talking. I then listen to music, play games on the PC, watch TV series or sit and read.

Now I know better how to get out of the overstimulation of myself. This is different for every person. What works for me does not always work for others.
