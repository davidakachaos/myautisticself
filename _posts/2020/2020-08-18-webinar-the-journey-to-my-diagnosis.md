On the 26th of August at 20:00 in the evening I will give a webinar about my journey to the diagnosis of autism. It will be my personal story in which I will discuss the challenges of the past, the road I have travelled and where I am now.

During the webinar there will also be room to ask questions. I hope to see you at my first public webinar on August 26th! Be advised that the webinar will be in Dutch! There will be no translation available at the time, sorry. Maybe in the future I will do an English one.

This webinar is made possible by the [Autisme Netwerk Friesland](http://www.autismenetwerkfriesland.nl/nieuws)
