2020, the year in which Corona (COVID) was most central to our lives. 2020 was a strange year, where we were mainly at home. For me, this year was really about expanding what I am doing. The last few months I have focused on doing my podcast. I also did my first webinar. [This]({% link _posts/2020-09-28-video-webinar-online_en.md %}) was about my journey to diagnosis.

All in all, with the exception of Corona of course, 2020 is a successful year for me.

## The AutCast

The AutCast](/assets/img/autcast2.png){: class='ui image medium floated right'}.
My podcast, the [AutCast](https://autcast.myautisticself.nl/) is the one I started in early 2020. A podcast about neurodiversity and autism in particular. With this I will certainly be doing more in 2021. I've already had some guests, and I'm planning more to talk to.

The podcast is a way to reach and inform more and more people about autism. It also provides a platform for others to talk about autism as well as myself. My hope for 2021 is that I will be able to meet more people through the AutCast and have more interesting conversations with more people. As I always say on the podcast, everyone is free to contact me to come and talk on the podcast.

## The blog

Now it has been a while since I have posted a piece. Inspiration is a big reason for this, but also that I have focused more on the podcast in recent months. However, now that it seems to be well on its way, I hope to be able to spend more time on it as well. Perhaps a little more in-depth discussion of the issues I will be discussing in the podcast. So that they come together more and more.

I also hope to be able to give more lectures next year. That was my biggest plan for this year. However, because of Corona it has all become a lot less than hoped for. But if we can get Corona under control with each other, it will also attract more. Then I hope to be able to join forces with organisations as well.

## After Corona

As I said, after Corona, I hope to do more and more with my dreams. We have all had a hard time, but that time is coming to an end. In 2021, I hope that we can all come together again. That we can come together in groups and that we can talk to each other in person. I myself don't have many problems talking to each other "alone" online, but I also know that most people crave to be able to get back together again.
