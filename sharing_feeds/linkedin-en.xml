        <title><![CDATA[Accept another, start with yourself!<br />
<br />
The acceptance of autism by society is an important reason to write about it in my eyes. However, it is not the beginning. Improve the world, start with yourself! But why is this so important? What have I done to accept my autism and myself?<br />
<br />
I wrote a piece about it with my own journey to acceptance. About the how and why it has been so important for me and why I think it is important for everyone.<br />
<br />
If you want acceptance, it starts with yourself. Sharing is appreciated!<br />
