        <title><![CDATA[Accepting autism in yourself<br />
<br />
The acceptance of autism by society is an important reason to write about it in my opinion. However, it is not the beginning. Improve the world, start with yourself! But why is this so important? What have I done to accept my autism?<br />
<br />
I wrote a piece about it with my own journey to acceptance. About the how and why it has been so important to me and why I think it is important to everyone.<br />
<br />
Do you accept your autism? If so, was this difficult for you? If not, what's stopping you?<br />
