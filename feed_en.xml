        <title>17 ways to say “I love you” in neurodivergent</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/iloveyoutalen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I love you&quot; class=&quot;ui image medium floated right&quot; /&gt; I copied this list from @SNeurotypicals who shared it via &lt;a href=&quot;https://theaspergian.com/2020/02/04/17-ways-to-say-i-love-you-in-neurodivergent/&quot;&gt;The Aspergian&lt;/a&gt;. I have translated it into Dutch :smile:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;17 Ways to Say “I Love You” in &lt;abbr title=&quot;This can refer to a person [noun] who is autistic or has other atypical brain neurology (ADHD, dyslexic, dyspraxic, etc.) or the quality [adjective] of being a neurodivergent person&quot;&gt;Neurodivergent&lt;/abbr&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;I saw this article/site and wanted to share with you.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Here is a thing about your favourite thing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I would spend unstructured time with you.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You can share my silence.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I researched your problem; here are your options.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I love your project so much, I thought of some ways to make it even better.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Do you need a ride home from your mundane errand that should be no big deal but is actually a Big Deal?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I see you’re freaking out. That’s cool. I will chill here in silence until you need me.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;[thumbs up emoji]&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I will make that phone call/book that appointment so you don’t have to.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I knew you would forget, so I did [insert thing here]&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;This is your reminder to do the self care thing.&lt;br...

        <title>How a traffic light and pans can help</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/stoplicht.png&quot; alt=&quot;Traffic light&quot; class=&quot;ui image floated right medium&quot; /&gt; In the past I have followed the necessary therapies to cope with my depression. One of those therapies was to make a so-called signalling plan. This is a plan in which you have to write down what you and your surroundings can notice about your state of mind. Often this is made with a traffic light. People who have been in treatment for depression themselves may already have an idea how this works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;traffic-light-on-green&quot;&gt;Traffic light on green&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several stages in which you can classify yourself. These are the colours of a traffic light; green, yellow and red. As explained to me, the green phase is the stable phase, the phase in which you feel good. Nowadays I am usually here. The other colors are less and less stable or “good”. The redder you are, the worse you are. Although it is usually clear to yourself that you are doing worse than normal, this is not always clear to those around you. The purpose of a signalling plan is to make this clear to the people around you. The phases look different for everyone. For example, one person...

        <title>It all starts with understanding</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/understandingeachother.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Understanding each other&quot; class=&quot;ui image floated left medium top aligned&quot; /&gt; Understanding each other is the most important thing on the way to a good society in my eyes. Having an understanding for someone else is important, but having an understanding for yourself may be even more important. During my discovery of what autism means to me and what influence it has on me, I also learned to understand myself more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m in different Facebook groups that deal with neurodiversity or autism in different ways. I get a lot of different stories from many different angles. From parents of autistic people, from autistic people themselves and from organisations within the neurodiverse movement. They offer a lot of information and support. From stories about successes to stories about abuse and discrimination, everything gives me more and more insight into what autism is like for people. And it’s clear to me that it all starts with understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Understanding each other, for each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-your-own-neurodiversity&quot;&gt;Understanding your own neurodiversity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many autistic people don’t feel understood by the world around them. I myself have always been troubled by this. I did not feel understood and did not always understand the world around...

        <title>Meltdown - Old vs New behavior</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/a-blue-brain-with-lightning-bolts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mind Melting Down&quot; class=&quot;ui image floated right&quot; /&gt; My thoughts are running through my head and through each other. My head is full and I notice I’m scared. My body gives all the classical signals for this; my heart beats much faster, my eyes wander over everything without seeing much, my breathing is much faster than normal. For me the worst thing is that I lose my self-control, my grip on my reactions and the mask with which I filter my statements normally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, this is my so-called meltdown. A meltdown is not something that only children with autism have, even adult autistic people run into it from time to time. And for every autistic person a meltdown is different. There are certainly similarities between meltdowns and they are all extremely miserable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-a-meltdown-for-me&quot;&gt;What’s a meltdown for me?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like everything on this blog, I write this from my own experience, my view of the world. Like I wrote, a meltdown is different for everyone. My meltdowns are characterized by the loss of my social mask and the inability to interact socially. It often expresses itself in anger and sadness. Answers to questions are short and with an...

        <title>36 questions for me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Something different today. On different blogs you will come across them, the lists of questions generally asked to people to get to know each other better. So there are 36 of them and I try to answer them all below. If you have any more questions about this question and answer session, please let me know via for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WesterinkDavid&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/myautisticself/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; :smile:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But now, without further delay, the questions and answers:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert&quot;&gt;Are you an introvert or an extrovert?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have called myself an introvert for years. Nowadays I’m not so sure. I think I fall somewhere between the two extremes. Although I am very fond of my own space and certainly need it to recharge, I also enjoy talking to people and going out with friends. Unfortunately I don’t do the latter enough, largely for financial reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;suppose-you-only-have-a-year-to-live-what-would-you-do&quot;&gt;Suppose you only have a year to live, what would you do?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say goodbye to friends and family. Put things in order. Show my children how to deal with the impending death. And maybe some less beautiful things I’d better not make public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-you-want-to-be-as-a-child&quot;&gt;What did you want to be as a child?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Policeman. That seemed like a...

        <title>Autism as a cloud</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spectrum (also called gradient) - (plural: spectra or spectrums) is a range of consecutive colours or sounds or other varieties. This term is often used in physics. &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/ads-cloud-head.jpg&quot; data-srcset=&quot;/assets/resized/80/ads-cloud-head.jpg 80w,/assets/resized/20/ads-cloud-head.jpg 20w,/assets/resized/300/ads-cloud-head.jpg 300w, /assets/img/ads-cloud-head.jpg 395w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; class=&quot;progressive replace ui image floated medium right&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/resized/20/ads-cloud-head.jpg&quot; class=&quot;preview ui image floated medium right&quot; alt=&quot;Autism als een wolk&quot; title=&quot;Autism als een wolk&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we talk about ASD one of the first things we do is pronounce the abbreviation completely; Autism Spectrum Disorder. About the last word, disorder, &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/disorder-condition-disease.html&quot;&gt;I’ve already written&lt;/a&gt;. Today I’d like to discuss the second word, spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the definition indicates, a spectrum is a range of successive diversities. In my opinion, this is an incorrect representation of autism. It leads to different problems when thinking about autism. It leads to the labeling of forms of autism, the thinking that there are “not bad” and “heavy” forms of autism, that you can place someone on a straight line and so on by means of some outward displays. I think it is not as easy as that. People with autism are very different, but classifying them in a straight line doesn’t...

        <title>Thinking in terms of solutions, not problems</title>

This statement stayed with me when I started to rebuild myself. Another statement I once heard (I don’t know exactly when, it’s been a long time) is: “Problems are problems, because they have a solution. If a problem has no solution, it is not a problem but a fact”. From these two statements I have reasoned further for myself. If a problem has no solution, it is a fact. Ergo; if a fact has a solution, it is a problem. Facts are by definition not “solvable”, they can change, but (mostly) you can’t change that much yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may sound like I’m trying to put my problems aside with this, but that’s not quite what I mean by that. If you “solve” a problem in your life as far as you can, but it’s still there (assuming it has decreased in size or...

        <title>Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/12/end-of-the-year.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I already looked back at 2019. Today I would simply like to wish you all Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading my blogs and the feedback I’m receiving through Facebook/Twitter and &lt;abbr title=&quot;In Real Life&quot;&gt;IRL&lt;/abbr&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

It is the year in which I started this blog and in which I developed myself personally. Christmas is just around the corner and in all sorts of places on the internet people round off their year and look back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;blogging-about-autism&quot;&gt;Blogging about autism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year I started with this blog. My goal was not fixed when I started this blog; I wanted to write about autism and how I experience the world around me. Since I started with this blog, I have found out more and more that I want to work towards the acceptance of autism and neurodiversity. Writing my blog gives me a lot; I’m learning more and more about myself and my autistic side, I’ve met people on Twitter and noticed that there are people who appreciate my blogs. It is certainly something I will continue to do in the new year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although I’ve often started things in the past and had trouble finishing them (so many projects I started with an idea, but ended up...

Ever since you were two, your mother has noticed differences between you and your sister. And yesterday you were diagnosed with autism. And now I can officially welcome you to the neurodiverse world. Your mother and I have known for ages that you are on the spectrum, your behavior and your difficulties are very recognizable to me. Also my guidance and the help at your mother’s home, who has a lot of experience with autism, found that you were very clearly on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now I welcome you to the “club”, the “tribe” or the team. And I’m very happy that we now have the diagnosis officially. This means that in the future you can get the help you need. It means that money will be available to help you. It also confirms what we have known for years; you really look like your father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;fighting-for-acceptance&quot;&gt;Fighting for acceptance&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With my blog I fight for acceptance of neurodiversity. Now not only for myself and others, but also for you. I wish you a world that doesn’t look down on you. That people see...
