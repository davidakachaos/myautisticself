        <title>Time is a strange thing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/time-warp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time is relative&quot; class=&quot;ui image floated right medium&quot; /&gt;. Time is a concept we don’t think much about. Time is a way of measuring how long something has been or how long it will last. As we now know, time is also relative. That means that time is not always experienced in the same way. A famous example is that of a stove; 5 seconds with your hand on a hot stove is very long, but 5 minutes to be with your loved one is too short.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time also differs when it comes to experience between people. I notice this almost every day. Of course this has to do with many different factors, such as culture, upbringing and patience. Still, I notice that my awareness of time differs from the neurotypical people around me. I find it very difficult to remember how long ago a certain incident was. I have to remember this with hints, such as documents that are dated and have a relationship with the incident. Or with help from people who were there. Otherwise it soon becomes a case of “about 5-7 years ago, I believe”. And whether that’s true then, depends on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2...

        <title>The problem with #LightItUpBlue</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/lightitup.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Light it up!&quot; class=&quot;image ui floated right&quot; /&gt; Maybe you’ve heard of it before, the campaign of organisations dealing with autism to illuminate their buildings in blue to draw attention to autism. Different buildings are then put in the spotlight with blue light. But where does this come from? Who came up with this? And why do I call this a problem?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The campaign was devised by an American organization called “Autism Speaks”. This organization is one of the major powers behind the search for a “solution” to autism. In other words, a “cure”. They want to rid the world of autistic people. Of course they don’t say this directly, but since autism is not a disease and therefore has no cure, it is the only logical conclusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;autism-speaks-the-creator-of&quot;&gt;Autism Speaks, the creator of…&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The campaign #LightItUpBlue was conceived by the organisation Autism Speaks. The reason for the colour blue? Simple; the colour of men. After all, autism is a man’s disease. Of course the latter is sarcasm. We know better these days. Women can be autistic as well as men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Autism Speaks originates from the old generation, people who are sincerely looking for a cure for autism....

        <title>Autism is a construction, not a disease New scientific research</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/deep-brain-stimulation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Brain Power&quot; class=&quot;ui image medium floated right&quot; /&gt; Recently, a so-called “primer” has been released in which the state of scientific research into autism is discussed. The original article can be read by anyone via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/31949163/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; but is very extensive. Fortunately, Dr. Ruby Sapphire has summarized this on twitter. Dr. Sapphire is affiliated with the King’s College in London and tweets regularly about the science behind autism. In this piece I want to talk about some of the points she summed up from the “primer”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;autism-is-not-a-disease&quot;&gt;Autism is not a disease?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The first think to note, is that the authors come straight out of the box and say “autism is a construct”. Yep that’s right, not a disease or even a “real” entity at all but a construct used to describe a very diverse group of individuals who share some core similarities.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dr. Ruby Sapphire (@Sophie88403973) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Sophie88403973/status/1225904001830379520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, this study acknowledges that autism is not a “disease”, but a construction by which symptoms are described that we collectively call autism. I myself have hated the term “disease”, “ condition” or “disorder” associated with autism...

        <title>How a traffic light and pans can help</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/stoplicht.png&quot; alt=&quot;Traffic light&quot; class=&quot;ui image floated right medium&quot; /&gt; In the past I have followed the necessary therapies to cope with my depression. One of those therapies was to make a so-called signalling plan. This is a plan in which you have to write down what you and your surroundings can notice about your state of mind. Often this is made with a traffic light. People who have been in treatment for depression themselves may already have an idea how this works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;traffic-light-on-green&quot;&gt;Traffic light on green&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several stages in which you can classify yourself. These are the colours of a traffic light; green, yellow and red. As explained to me, the green phase is the stable phase, the phase in which you feel good. Nowadays I am usually here. The other colors are less and less stable or “good”. The redder you are, the worse you are. Although it is usually clear to yourself that you are doing worse than normal, this is not always clear to those around you. The purpose of a signalling plan is to make this clear to the people around you. The phases look different for everyone. For example, one person...

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/understandingeachother.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Understanding each other&quot; class=&quot;ui image floated left medium top aligned&quot; /&gt; Understanding each other is the most important thing on the way to a good society in my eyes. Having an understanding for someone else is important, but having an understanding for yourself may be even more important. During my discovery of what autism means to me and what influence it has on me, I also learned to understand myself more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m in different Facebook groups that deal with neurodiversity or autism in different ways. I get a lot of different stories from many different angles. From parents of autistic people, from autistic people themselves and from organisations within the neurodiverse movement. They offer a lot of information and support. From stories about successes to stories about abuse and discrimination, everything gives me more and more insight into what autism is like for people. And it’s clear to me that it all starts with understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Understanding each other, for each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-your-own-neurodiversity&quot;&gt;Understanding your own neurodiversity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many autistic people don’t feel understood by the world around them. I myself have always been troubled by this. I did not feel understood and did not always understand the world around...

        <title>Meltdown - Old vs New behavior</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/a-blue-brain-with-lightning-bolts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mind Melting Down&quot; class=&quot;ui image floated right&quot; /&gt; My thoughts are running through my head and through each other. My head is full and I notice I’m scared. My body gives all the classical signals for this; my heart beats much faster, my eyes wander over everything without seeing much, my breathing is much faster than normal. For me the worst thing is that I lose my self-control, my grip on my reactions and the mask with which I filter my statements normally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, this is my so-called meltdown. A meltdown is not something that only children with autism have, even adult autistic people run into it from time to time. And for every autistic person a meltdown is different. There are certainly similarities between meltdowns and they are all extremely miserable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-a-meltdown-for-me&quot;&gt;What’s a meltdown for me?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like everything on this blog, I write this from my own experience, my view of the world. Like I wrote, a meltdown is different for everyone. My meltdowns are characterized by the loss of my social mask and the inability to interact socially. It often expresses itself in anger and sadness. Answers to questions are short and with an...

        <title>36 questions for me</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Something different today. On different blogs you will come across them, the lists of questions generally asked to people to get to know each other better. So there are 36 of them and I try to answer them all below. If you have any more questions about this question and answer session, please let me know via for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WesterinkDavid&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/myautisticself/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; :smile:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But now, without further delay, the questions and answers:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert&quot;&gt;Are you an introvert or an extrovert?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have called myself an introvert for years. Nowadays I’m not so sure. I think I fall somewhere between the two extremes. Although I am very fond of my own space and certainly need it to recharge, I also enjoy talking to people and going out with friends. Unfortunately I don’t do the latter enough, largely for financial reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;suppose-you-only-have-a-year-to-live-what-would-you-do&quot;&gt;Suppose you only have a year to live, what would you do?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say goodbye to friends and family. Put things in order. Show my children how to deal with the impending death. And maybe some less beautiful things I’d better not make public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-you-want-to-be-as-a-child&quot;&gt;What did you want to be as a child?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Policeman.

        <title>Autism as a cloud</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spectrum (also called gradient) - (plural: spectra or spectrums) is a range of consecutive colours or sounds or other varieties. This term is often used in physics. &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/ads-cloud-head.jpg&quot; data-srcset=&quot;/assets/resized/80/ads-cloud-head.jpg 80w,/assets/resized/20/ads-cloud-head.jpg 20w,/assets/resized/300/ads-cloud-head.jpg 300w, /assets/img/ads-cloud-head.jpg 395w&quot; data-sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; class=&quot;progressive replace ui image floated medium right&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/resized/20/ads-cloud-head.jpg&quot; class=&quot;preview ui image floated medium right&quot; alt=&quot;Autism als een wolk&quot; title=&quot;Autism als een wolk&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we talk about ASD one of the first things we do is pronounce the abbreviation completely; Autism Spectrum Disorder. About the last word, disorder, &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/disorder-condition-disease.html&quot;&gt;I’ve already written&lt;/a&gt;. Today I’d like to discuss the second word, spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the definition indicates, a spectrum is a range of successive diversities. In my opinion, this is an incorrect representation of autism. It leads to different problems when thinking about autism. It leads to the labeling of forms of autism, the thinking that there are “not bad” and “heavy” forms of autism, that you can place someone on a straight line and so on by means of some outward displays. I think it is not as easy as that. People with autism are very different, but classifying them in a straight line doesn’t...

This statement stayed with me when I started to rebuild myself. Another statement I once heard (I don’t know exactly when, it’s been a long time) is: “Problems are problems, because they have a solution. If a problem has no solution, it is not a problem but a fact”. From these two statements I have reasoned further for myself. If a problem has no solution, it is a fact. Ergo; if a fact has a solution, it is a problem. Facts are by definition not “solvable”, they can change, but (mostly) you can’t change that much yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may sound like I’m trying to put my problems aside with this, but that’s not quite what I mean by that. If you “solve” a problem in your life as far as you can, but it’s still there (assuming it has decreased in size or...
