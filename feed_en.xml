A supervisor of the day care where I come announces that it is time again for the time to sit around a table with others. It is meant as a moment of rest, stepping out of work and taking time to relax.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most people, taking breaks is a moment of rest. For me this is also the case, but not when I do this with people around me. I take breaks by taking a moment for myself. For me this means getting a cup of coffee and going outside to smoke. Because I am one of the few smokers, I always do this alone. Just a moment for myself where I can think about things and have peace of mind from my work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;social-interaction-is-tiring&quot;&gt;Social interaction is tiring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For me, social interaction is tiring. Having conversations, keeping them going and dividing attention between different people is a task in itself for me. It is seen as a flaw...

I’m always looking for information, on all kinds of different subjects. To form an opinion about something, or because it’s an interesting subject for me, or because someone asks me a question about something I don’t know much about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I got my diagnosis, after a while I started looking for all kinds of information about my diagnosis of Asperger. There was a lot of information on the internet. In all kinds of forms. YouTube videos, wikipedia pages, blogs, Facebook groups and so on. Today I’m going to talk about another source of information; the podcasts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;podcasts&quot;&gt;Podcasts?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nowadays everything is more and more “on demand”. Think of Netflix, for example; you can see on your own time the series you want to see at that moment. This system is far from new. If we think of a library, for example, you can see that the idea of something decreases when you need...

When I try to explain my way of thinking to a neurotypical person, I often explain it as a kind of large spider web.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spider web in which I am busy linking everything together. I weave my webs between the different places in my mind where information and / or feelings are stored. Described by Michel as drawers. Although I often propose these places as filing cabinets, this metaphor seems very clear and clear to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;weaving-cobwebs&quot;&gt;Weaving cobwebs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I think about something, threads form on my spider web. My spider web is shaped very differently than that of a neurotypical person. The way I make connections works (apparently) differently. Because of this I make connections, that other people don’t make. This naturally has advantages and disadvantages. It means that sometimes I don’t understand things that others do. Or what’s even worse, that I don’t understand things in the...

That is the statistic of autists with depression. A shocking amount of people. And unfortunately I was also one of the victims of a major depression. A depression that dragged me through a very dark valley. A depression that completely destroyed me. Fortunately I climbed out again. And I can say today that I am no longer in that major depression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 id=&quot;how-i-see-my-depressive-periods&quot;&gt;How I see my depressive periods&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may sound strange to say, but I am happy with the time I have been through. It led to my diagnosis with Asperger’s syndrome. It has also taught me what it means to have to start all over again, mentally, and to rebuild everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me be clear; depression is NOT fun. Far from. It is a very common disease and can lead to death. It is not a subject to deal with lightly. It is no way to get attention or to have an excuse for...

In essence, this is what Dungeons and Dragons is all about. Dungeons and Dragons is a game where a story is told by a so-called Dungeon Master and the players of the game are the main characters. When I explain the game to people who don’t know the game at all, I always compare it to a book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 id=&quot;play-your-own-story&quot;&gt;Play your own story&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like to read. In books, I can lose myself and become completely absorbed in the story. Most of the books I read contain hardly any images. Everything therefore depends on my own fantasy. Obviously controlled by the author of the book. The author has a certain vision for the story and puts it into words in the book. From there you build your own view of the story, with your own representation of the events in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For me, that is a great way to stimulate my own imagination. Dungeons and Dragons takes this one step further. Instead of letting the story be determined...

Do you have autism or are you an autist? The choice is pretty clear to me; I am an autist. Autism is a part of who I am. It determines who I am as a person. There are more things that determine who I am as a person; I am a man, I am a Dutchman, I am a father, I am a realist and so on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-the-problem-anyway&quot;&gt;What is the problem anyway?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;These days it is “in” to be politically correct. We try to hit as few people as possible and, above all, we don’t want to hit people. We see plenty of examples of this in our society and world pasture. And then this kind of “discussion” comes up again. Is it now “wrong” to say that people with autism are autistic? Should we not do that because it puts the disease at the center? Because about people with another disease such as cancer, are we better to say that it is...

        <title>Music vs. Silence</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/music.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Muziek noten&quot; class=&quot;ui right floated image medium&quot; /&gt; When I’m busy with work or writing this blog, for example, I “need” to have music on. I know there are many people who prefer to work in silence, but for me that doesn’t actually work. I need music on to work concentrated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 id=&quot;music-on-concentration-on&quot;&gt;Music on, concentration on&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;By playing music, I can concentrate better. I listen to many different types of music when I work, but mostly the somewhat “louder” music. This can be, like now, Rammstein. But also hardcore, speedcore, terror, metal, folk, sometimes classical … It’s anything. I actually prefer hardcore, but I listen to all kinds of music.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I have music on, I can close myself off to the world around me. I can concentrate on my work or on writing a blog. If I don’t have music on, this is a lot harder for me. Writing a blog is easy and easy for me. However, I can get distracted quickly when I hear conversations around me, for example. However, if I can’t hear the conversations through the music, then logically they don’t distract me either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 id=&quot;sound-over-stimulation&quot;&gt;Sound over-stimulation?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know that there are many...

        <title>10 money questions for ...</title>

Unfortunately, in our society (globally, not specifically in the Netherlands), money plays a very important role in everyone’s life. Without money, living in a western country is very difficult. But whether I’m personally doing a lot about it? No actually not. I am not very handy with money matters either. That is why I am in budget management.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is money a driver for you?&lt;/strong&gt; Partially. I won’t lie and say that money doesn’t hurt me. But it is not the primary motivator in my life. It is a means of survival and is therefore always good to have. Money alone does not make them happy, but it is always better to cry in a vila than in a box on the street.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you consider the financial consequences of changes in your life?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. If it is a change in my life that...

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/wall_e_pod_hires.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Website update&quot; class=&quot;ui right floated image large&quot; /&gt; Since I started this blog I have used a comment system called Disqus. This blog was not actually used by visitors to my blog. Not so strange actually, because most of the reactions I get outside of my blog. In particular via Twitter and Facebook. Commenting via the blog itself was never actually done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not bad at all, finally I also share my blogs via social media and I also respond to the feedback I receive there. However, it is true that my blog was delayed by the Disqus system. So today I decided to remove the comments. Instead I will use another system called “Webmentions”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 id=&quot;webmentions-what-is-that&quot;&gt;Webmentions? What is that?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;I myself am an computer person, but I will try to explain the concept here without too much technical fuss and difficult words. Webmentions is a technology where websites can respond to each other. This is a system that has been roaming the internet for some time. You may have heard about the concept of “Pingback”. Pingback is a way for a website (usually a blog) to let another website (also usually a blog) know that a...
